title: Village & Pillage out today on Java
---

Apparently, it takes a village to raise a child. Frankly, if we'd known how much work putting together the biggest Minecraft update yet was going to be, we'd have probably taken the easy option and tried to raise that child instead.

But it was all worth it for this, **Village & Pillage** Update release day! I can almost hear the Pillagers firing their crossbows into the air in celebration! Or are they firing them towards me...

Enjoy the update!
